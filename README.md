## Context
Stardew of Isaac is a game developed for a school project, during our third semester. We were five students working on it.
It is a rogue-like game extremely inspired by two games: Stardew Valley and Binding of Isaac. We wanted to improve our skills, and we decided to do so by mashing up two fantastic games.

This game has been created in C99, with SDL 1.2 using SDL_Image, SDL_Mixer and SDL_TTF.
