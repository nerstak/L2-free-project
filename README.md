## Installation for dev on Windows
First, clone the repository on your computer. Also, download and set up **SDL 1.2.15**. Please intall it inside the CodeBlocks folder if you work with it. Download SDL_Image (the binary for VC), and add SD_Image.h inside the include folder of SDL, with all the other .h files. Put SDL_Image.lib inside the lib folder. Finally put SDL.dll and every other dll that were inside SDL_Image in the project folder.
